# python-basics
A structured learning journey into Python fundamentals, starting from Week 1 basics and progressing step by step.  This repository will be updated weekly with practice programs, notes, and mini-projects.

# Week 1: Python Basics & Control Structures  

### 📝 Goal  
Understand the core building blocks of Python.  

### 📌 Topics Covered  
- Variables & Data Types (`int`, `float`, `string`, `boolean`)  
- Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `//`, `**`)  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else`, `elif`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  

### 💻 Practice Programs  
1. **calculator.py** - Simple calculator performing +, -, *, /  
2. **even_odd_checker.py** - Checks if a number is even or odd  
3. **multiplication_table.py** - Generates multiplication table of a number     

# Week 2: Functions, Lists & Dictionaries

### 📝 Goal  
Learn how to organize code and store data efficiently.

### 📌 Topics Covered  
- Defining and calling **functions** (`def`, `return`, parameters)  
- **Lists** → storing items in order (e.g., `[10, 20, 30]`)  
- **Dictionaries** → storing data in key-value pairs (e.g., `{"name": "Alice", "score": 95}`)  

### 💻 Practice Programs  
1. **functions_example.py** – Write a simple function that greets a user  
2. **list_example.py** – Store and display a list of student names  
3. **dictionary_example.py** – Store and display student scores using a dictionary  
4. **student_scores.py** – Store student scores and add a function to calculate the average score

# Week 3: File Handling & Error Handling

###  📝 Goal
Learn how to read and write data to files, and handle errors smoothly.

### 📌 Topics Covered
- Opening, reading, and writing .txt and .csv files in Python (open, read, write, with)
- File modes → "r" (read), "w" (write), "a" (append)
- Error handling with try, except, finally

### 💻 Practice Programs
1. **write_file.py** – Write some text into a file
2. **read_file.py** – Read and display the contents of a file
3. **append_file.py** – Append new text into an existing file
4. **error_handling.py** – Demonstrate error handling using try and except
5. **contact_book.py** – Build a simple contact book that stores names & numbers in a file

# Week 4: Mini Project: Python Application  

### 📝 Goal  
Apply everything you’ve learned so far in a real-world mini project: plan, build, test, and improve a small Python application.  

### 📌 Topics Covered  
- Breaking a problem into input → logic → output → data storage  
- Organizing code with **functions**  
- File handling for saving project data (`.json`, `.txt`, `.csv`)  
- User input handling in CLI apps  
- Testing and improving the program  
- (Optional) Using APIs (for projects like Weather Info)  

### 💻 Practice Programs / Files to Create  
1. **todo_cli.py** – Build a To-Do List CLI app (starter code provided below).
