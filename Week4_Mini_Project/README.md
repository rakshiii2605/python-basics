# Week 4: Mini Project: Python Application  

### 📖 Goal  
Apply everything you’ve learned so far in a real-world mini project: plan, build, test, and improve a small Python application.  

### 📌 Topics Covered  
- Breaking a problem into input → logic → output → data storage  
- Organizing code with **functions**  
- File handling for saving project data (`.json`, `.txt`, `.csv`)  
- User input handling in CLI apps  
- Testing and improving the program  
- (Optional) Using APIs (for projects like Weather Info)  

### 📝 Practice Programs / Files to Create  
1. **todo_cli.py** – Build a To-Do List CLI app (starter code provided below).
