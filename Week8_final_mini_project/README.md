# Week 8 : final mini project

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
Apply everything learned so far by building a meaningful Python project.

### ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Breaking down a project into smaller steps (input â†’ logic â†’ output â†’ save data)
- Using functions to organize code
- File handling & error handling
- Working with APIs / CSV files
- Building a complete mini project

### ðŸ›  Steps to Follow
1. Pick one project idea (File Organizer, Student Result System, Daily Expense Tracker, or Stock Tracker).
2. Plan the workflow: take inputs, process logic, display output, and save data.
3. Use Python concepts: functions, loops, file handling, exceptions, and libraries.
4. Test the program with different inputs and refine it.

### ðŸ’» Practice Programs 
1. file_organizer.py â€“ Organizes files into folders (Documents, Images, CSV, etc.).
2. student_result_system.py â€“ Stores marks, calculates averages, and displays results.
3. daily_expense_tracker.py â€“ Tracks expenses and saves them into a CSV file.
4. stock_tracker.py â€“ Fetches stock prices using an API and displays updates.
